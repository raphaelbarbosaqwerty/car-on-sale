## Improvments

### HttpClient

One of my ideas was to abstract the `HttpClient` used in the `CosChallenge` that was provided to handle some specific exceptions in there, like status 400 errors. But I ended up focusing more on E2E and Unit tests within the App.

### Cache system

Without a doubt this is a part that is interesting to improve, currently, it is a simple caching system using Hive, but if we had a valid database, we could do something like offline-first with automatic integration system.

### Tests

I have some good things to improve on the testing part.

### Documentation

I need to work more to improve the documentation.
