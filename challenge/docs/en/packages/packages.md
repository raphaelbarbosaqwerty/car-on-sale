# Packages used and why

## Get_it

Is a simples package for dependency injection, useful for the tests.

## Hive

As it wasn't using a massive amount of data it was an ideal choice. Decided to use for the cache behavior, simple package and solve our problem in that case.

## Bloc/Cubit

As CarOnSale currently uses Bloc/Cubit, I decided to use it to get closer to reality.

## Equatable

Object comparisons, help on bloc/cubit.

## EmailValidator

Simple email validator for initial authentication.

## Mocktail

Because the mocktail was developed by the same creator of Bloc/Cubit, I decided to use this one.

## Route?

I decided not to use any because there are few screens, there was no need to configure decided to keep it simple.
